As part of the course "OOP in C# and the .Net Framework" in computer science degree at The Academic College of Tel-Aviv Yaffo, We developed the popular game "Checkers" in the English version for the windows application. The game was developed in C# using OOP concepts, Windows Forms and the .NET framework.

### Game rules
Checkers is played by two opponents on opposite sides of the game board. Players alternate turns.
A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece has to be captured by jumping over it.
A piece can only move diagonally into an unoccupied square, and when capturing an opponent's piece is possible, capturing is mandatory.

**When does the game end?**

The player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game. After finish single game there is an option to start another game and the player's score updating.

**How is the score calculated?**

* Each regular tool remaining at the end - **1 Point**
* Each king tool remaining at the end - **4 points**
